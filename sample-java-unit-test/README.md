# Sample Java Unit Test For Oxygen Framework

A sample Java unit test for a framework customization.

See the actual test [CustomAuthorOperationTest](src/test/java/com/oxygenxml/samples/SampleTest.java).

### Motivation:
Test-driven development enables great development speed because you can test changes without having to restart Oxygen XML Editor or Oxygen XML Web Author.
Another great advantage is that multiple users can work on the project without fear of breaking everything after each commit, that's because regressions are caught by the unit tests.


### How to run the tests:
Execute "mvn clean test". Note that Maven is required to be installed.
