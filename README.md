# Oxygen Sample Frameworks

A *framework* refers to a package that contains resources and configuration information to provide ready-to-use support for an XML vocabulary or document type. A *framework* is associated to an XML document type according to a set of rules. It also includes a variety of settings that improve editing capabilities for its particular file type. 

These frameworks can be used with the Oxygen applications that have an authoring interface:
- Oxygen XML Editor
- Oxygen XML Author
- Oxygen XML Web Author
- Oxygen Content Fusion

This project contains sample frameworks that can be used as starting a point to create a customized authoring experience for an XML vocabulary. For more details about customization possibilities, check out the user manual: https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-editor/topics/authoring\_customization.html .
